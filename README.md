#### Section 1: Using Typescript write a module that generates 5 random unique pins.
These pins must fit the following requirements:
1. Each PIN is unique from the other 4 pins
2. Each PIN is random
3. Each PIN uses only digits 09
4. A PIN cannot contain 3 or more consecutive ascending or descending digits. *e.g 1235 or 5431 would be an invalid output*
5. A PIN cannot have 2 consecutive digits be the same *e.g 1135 or 3511 would be an invalid output*
